# PINARD — Build Phases
Copy-paste these into Claude Code **one at a time, in order**. Test each phase before moving on. After each working feature, say: *"Commit this to Git with a clear message."*

**Before Phase 1:** create a folder, put `PROJECT.md`, `AI-PROMPTS.md` and `pinard-logo.svg` inside it, open a terminal in that folder, and run `claude`.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation
```
Read PROJECT.md fully. Set up the project it describes: Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind, connected to Supabase. Configure the Tailwind theme with the exact colour tokens and the three Google Fonts from the design system. Create ALL database tables from section 6 with row-level security as specified, plus Supabase auth with email/password and the admin/user roles. Build the app shell: logo (use pinard-logo.svg), navigation, the footer disclaimer line, and the signature "trace" header underline component. I am a complete beginner: walk me through creating the Supabase project, enabling pgvector, and where to paste each key into .env.local, step by step. Then show me how to run the app locally and how to make my own account an admin.
```

## Phase 2 — Admin: sections, sources, examples
```
Read PROJECT.md sections 6–7. Build the /admin area, protected so only the admin role can access it: (1) the Sections manager, (2) the Source library with PDF/text upload — for now store the document and metadata without ingestion, (3) the Example questions manager for SBA and EMQ formats. Match the design system. Walk me through testing: I'll create the MRCOG Part 1 and Part 2 section trees, upload one document, and add five example questions.
```

## Phase 3 — Ingestion pipeline (RAG)
```
Read PROJECT.md section 7 (Source library) and AI-PROMPTS.md prompt K. Build the ingestion pipeline as a server-side job triggered on document upload: extract text (including from PDFs), chunk at 600–800 tokens with 15% overlap, embed each chunk with the Voyage AI API, store chunks + embeddings, then run prompt K per chunk and store the extracted key_facts. Show ingestion status and chunk/fact counts in the Source library. Also build the retrieval function: given a query string and section, return the top 8 chunks by vector similarity with their document titles and source references. Walk me through getting a Voyage API key and adding it to .env.local, then we'll test by uploading one real document and inspecting its chunks and key facts in the admin UI.
```

## Phase 4 — Question generation, verification, review queue
```
Read PROJECT.md sections 2 and 7, and AI-PROMPTS.md prompts G and Q. Build: (1) the generation service — server route that retrieves passages for a section, selects 3–4 style examples of the chosen format, calls the Anthropic API with G+Q, and parses the JSON; (2) the verification layer exactly as specified in PROJECT.md section 7, including the UK-English lint list and the regenerate-then-flag behaviour; (3) the admin Generation console; (4) the Review queue with Approve/Edit/Reject and A/E/R keyboard shortcuts, showing each citation with a click-through to the source passage. Walk me through adding my Anthropic API key, then we'll generate 10 questions for one section and I'll review them.
```

## Phase 5 — User app: sampler, onboarding, diagnostic, feedback
```
Read PROJECT.md section 7 (user app items 1–3 and 7) and AI-PROMPTS.md prompts F and C. Build: the free sampler with paywall page using the exact pricing table from PROJECT.md section 4; onboarding (exam part + exam date + countdown); the diagnostic screen with the end-of-diagnostic topic trace chart; and the full feedback screen — result banner, per-option explanations with citations via prompt F, the Similar Values panel driven by a key_facts value-match query (not the AI), and the follow-up "Ask Pinard" chat via prompt C with per-question message history. All question screens max-width 720px, mobile-first.
```

## Phase 6 — Study plan, daily sessions, progress
```
Read PROJECT.md section 7, items 4–6 and 8, and AI-PROMPTS.md prompt P. Build the deterministic study-plan algorithm exactly as described (weak-first weighting, full syllabus coverage, spaced revisits every 7–10 days, final-fortnight mixed papers), regenerating on material performance shifts or exam-date changes, with the narrative from prompt P. Then build the Daily session flow with the selection weighting formula, Free revision mode, and the Progress screen with per-section trace charts against the dashed 70% line, streak and totals.
```

## Phase 7 — Payments, reminders, motivation
```
Read PROJECT.md sections 4 and 7 (items 9–10) and AI-PROMPTS.md prompt M. Integrate Stripe subscriptions with the three paid tiers, the founding-member coupon, customer portal, and webhooks that maintain the subscriptions table; gate premium features on active status. Set up Resend and a daily cron that assembles each user's reminder at their chosen time using prompt M, plus milestone messages. Walk me through Stripe test mode end to end, including a test purchase and cancellation.
```

## Phase 8 — Deploy, then mobile
```
First: walk me through deploying to Vercel with all environment variables and the cron configured, connecting my domain, and a full production smoke test.

Then: add Capacitor to produce the iOS and Android apps from this codebase. Set up push notifications for the daily reminders and integrate RevenueCat for Apple/Google subscriptions at the same price points, coexisting with Stripe web billing. Generate the app icon set from pinard-logo.svg (the mark alone on theatre-green). Walk me through Xcode and Android Studio builds, then App Store and Play Store submission: listing copy, screenshots, the privacy policy (draft one from our actual data practices), and the medical-education disclaimer.
```

## Pre-launch hardening (October 2026)
Three phases, in order. Each runs on its own branch, ends with a plain-English report, and waits for the owner's "go ahead" before the next begins. Nothing is merged to `main` or deployed without approval. No data deletion, schema change, key rotation or Stripe / Supabase / Vercel setting change without asking first.

### Phase 9 — Design and motion  *(branch `phase-9-design-and-motion`)*
Status: **done and approved by the owner (9 October 2026); not yet merged to main.** Merging waits for the owner's say-so.

Progress (8 October 2026):
- Step 1 done: audit in `docs/design/DIRECTION.md`.
- Step 2 done and approved: "the guideline page" direction on the question screen and the landing page.
- Landing reworked at the owner's request: four steps (diagnostic, study plan, practise, mock) each with a picture that plays as it is reached; Ask Pinard as its own section; sections fade in and out in both scroll directions; one colour rule for every bar (red below a third, amber to 70%, green from 70%).
- Step 3 done in code: tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` (palette, type scale, radii, shadows, motion), Inter and Roboto Mono removed, a metric-matched fallback for Newsreader; shared components rebuilt; every page moved onto the system; all-caps labels, middle-dot strings and decorative arrows removed; new 404, error and loading-skeleton pages; light and dark.
- Step 4 done: page entrances, dialogs, bar fills, button press feedback; all 150 to 250ms, transform and opacity, off under reduced motion.
- Owner's review (9 October) done: one wide frame for header and footer on every page; sticky top bar with the current page marked; buttons grow on hover; Pricing and How it works in the wide frame with animation; How it works rewritten around provenance, currency and coverage; Today figures in a card; scroll fades on every signed-in page; mock fixes (diagonal part-answered sets, Back to mock, hand-in dialog); Progress redesigned around a CTG strip; diagnostic wording corrected (fifteen questions across 35 topics).
- Step 5 on public pages: Lighthouse mobile performance 91 to 96, accessibility 100, layout shift 0; axe WCAG 2.2 AA no violations; no sideways scroll at 360px.
- Review rounds 2 to 6 (9 October): slower motion; graded progress bars; connected session trace; diagnostic exit; plan focus in bold and no dashes; mock start, results and hand-in fixed; Account rebuilt; days to go recomputed daily; live section and paper figures; Join the pilot rebuilt; pricing cards clickable as a whole and carried through sign-in to Stripe.
- Signed-in screens were checked by the owner in their own browser; Lighthouse and axe were run on the public pages only.
- Left for later: Supabase's own auth email templates (a Supabase settings change, needs the owner's approval).
1. Audit every screen at phone and desktop widths; list what makes it look generic. No code changes.
2. Propose one design direction (calm, editorial, clinically confident, restrained) and build it on two screens only: the question/answer screen and the landing page. Before/after screenshots. **Wait for approval.**
3. Turn it into a design system (tokens in the Tailwind config: colour, type scale, spacing, radius, shadow, motion), rebuild shared components, apply to every page, emails and error pages; every state (loading skeletons, empty, error, success, disabled, focus); light and dark.
4. Purposeful motion only: 150–250 ms, ease-out, transform and opacity only, `prefers-reduced-motion`, smooth on a mid-range phone; no scroll-jacking.
5. Quality bar: WCAG 2.2 AA, works from 360 px, no layout shift, Lighthouse mobile 90+ (performance and accessibility); copy rewritten for MRCOG candidates.

### Phase 10 — Security  *(branch `phase-10-security`)*
Status: **all High, Medium and Low findings fixed (9 October 2026) except L5 (no patched release) and L6 (moved to Phase 11). H1, H3, H4 on `phase-10-security`; H2 (Next.js 15.5.27) and the Medium/Low fixes on `phase-10-next15`. phase41 and phase42 run by the owner; phase43 and two Supabase/Vercel settings pending. Nothing merged.** Report: `docs/security/REPORT.md` (0 Critical, 4 High, 7 Medium, 7 Low); OpenAPI spec: `docs/security/openapi.json`. 42Crunch replaced by the same method by hand (no account).
Report first (Critical / High / Medium / Low, each with what could actually happen); fix Critical and High after approval. Secrets in repo and history; Supabase RLS tested as a visitor and as user A against user B; server-side session and subscription checks on every route and action; access-code gate bypass and rate limiting; Stripe and RevenueCat webhook signatures and idempotency; AI endpoint limits, spend cap, prompt injection, no raw HTML; security headers, cookies, CSRF, input validation, open redirects, error messages; `npm audit` and patched Next.js (CVE-2025-29927); OpenAPI spec and 42Crunch audit and scan until clean; no personal data or keys in logs; automation recommendations (asked before installing). Tested against local or a preview deployment, never production.

### Phase 11 — Legal and compliance  *(branch `phase-11-legal`)*
Status: not started
Owner questions first (one at a time): registration, company or sole trader, legal name and address, countries sold to, content sources. Then: privacy policy matching the code (UK GDPR / DPA 2018 / EU GDPR, every processor, transfers, retention, rights, working deletion and export); cookies (PECR) and consent if needed; consumer law for subscriptions (price with tax, auto-renewal, easy cancellation, 14-day right and digital-content waiver, refunds, VAT); Terms, Privacy and Refunds readable without the access code; medical and AI disclaimers and labelling (EU AI Act transparency); RCOG non-affiliation and a source licence table; accessibility statement; marketing email opt-in and unsubscribe; app store requirements listed. Every item that needs a solicitor is marked.
